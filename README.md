# 🚀 100 Days of Python

Welcome to my **100 Days of Python** journey! 🎯  
This repository tracks my progress as I learn, code, and build projects in Python. My goal is to improve my skills, explore new libraries, and create fun and useful applications.  

## 📌 Projects Completed So Far  
Here are some of the projects I’ve built:  
✅ **Day 25: U.S. States Game** – A game using Turtle and Pandas to guess U.S. states.  
✅ **Hirst Painting** – A Python script that generates a Hirst dot painting.  
✅ **Mail Merge Project** – Automating personalized mail merging with Python.  
✅ **Pong Game** – A recreation of the classic Pong game using Turtle.  
✅ **Snake Game** – A simple Snake game using Object-Oriented Programming.  
✅ **Turtle Crossing Starter** – A fun game where a turtle crosses the road while avoiding cars.  
✅ **Coffee Machine** – A Python program that simulates a coffee machine.  

## 📚 What I’m Learning  
- Python basics and best practices  
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
